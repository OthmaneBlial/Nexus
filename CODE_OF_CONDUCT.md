# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in the Nexus project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing, and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using the official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at **nexus-maintainers@example.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

1. **Correction** – Private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Warning** – Public warning and a request for change of behavior. No further interaction with the people involved or the project for a specified period of time.
3. **Temporary Ban** – Temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.
